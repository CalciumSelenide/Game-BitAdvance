# Texas Instruments SN74HC148N 8:3 Encoder

The SNx4HC148 is an 8-input priority encoder. Added input enable (EI) and output enable (EO) signals allow for cascading multiple stages without added external circuitry.

### Symbol and Pinout
EI (Enable Input) must be pulled to GND in order to be active. GS (Get Signal) and EO (Enable Output) will change based on the inputs that the chip recieves - use the above truth table to determine the exact digital logic. Below, you will find a schematic symbol of the device which matches the pinout of the real-world device.
